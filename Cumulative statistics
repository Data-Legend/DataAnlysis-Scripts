Cumulative statistics can be useful in data analysis for various purposes, such as:

1 - Monitoring progress over time: Cumulative statistics can help to track the progress of a project or initiative over time. For example, a cumulative graph of sales revenue can show the total sales over a period of time, and help to identify trends and patterns in the data.

2- Forecasting: Cumulative statistics can also be used to predict future outcomes based on past trends. For instance, a cumulative graph of website traffic can be used to forecast the expected traffic for the next month or quarter.

4- Performance evaluation: Cumulative statistics can help to evaluate the performance of individuals, teams, or organizations over time. For instance, a cumulative graph of employee productivity can show the total output of an employee or team over a period of time, and help to identify areas where improvement is needed.

5- Comparison: Cumulative statistics can also be useful in comparing the performance of different entities. For example, a cumulative graph of sales revenue can show the total sales of different product lines or business units, and help to identify which ones are performing better.

Overall, cumulative statistics can provide a comprehensive view of the data, and help to identify trends and patterns that might not be visible with other methods of analysis
